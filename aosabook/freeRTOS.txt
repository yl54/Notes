intro
- FreeRTOS is a open source real-time operating system for embedded systems
- supports different architectures and compiler toolchains
- small, simple, easy to use
- q: what is a real time operating system?
- most of code dedicated to running tasks
- rtos source: https://github.com/cjlano/freertos

definitions
- embedded system
    - a computer system that is designed to only do a few things
    - like tv remote, digital watch, pacemaker
    - smaller, slower, less expensive than general purpose os 
- real time system
    - a system designed to do something within a certain amount of time
    - guarantee that stuff happens when its supposed to 
    - pacemaker 
        - has to do things at the exact time
        - carefully designed to run tasks on time, every time
    - cannot worry about respoonse time/latency

architecture overview
- optics
    - not too many .c files
        - go read these, should be manageable
    - typical binary code image is around 10KB
- core functions
    - tasks
        - create, schedule, maintain tasks
        - this is a concern in many operating systems
        - tasks.c and tasks.h deal with this
    - communication
        - need tasks that communicate with each other
        - queue.c and queue.h deal with this
        - tasks and interrupts use queues 
            - send data to each other
            - signal use of critical structures such as semaphores and mutexes
    - hardware whisperer
        - most code is hardware independent
        - a little code is a shim between hardware-independent and and hardware-dependent code
- hardware considerations
    - hardware-independent code sits on top of hardware-dependent code
    - ships with all of the code
    - support many different compilers (CodeWarrior, GCC, IAR, etc.)
    - supports many processor architectures (ARM7, ARM Cortex-M3, various PICs, Silicon Labs 8051, x86, etc.)
- configuration options
    - highly configurable
        - single CPU, bare-bones RTOS, supporting only a few tasks
        - highly functional multicore beast with TCP/IP, a file system, and USB
    - configuration options set in FreeRTOSConfig.h
        - set various defines: 
            #define configMAX_PRIORITIES      ( ( unsigned portBASE_TYPE ) 5 )
            #define configCPU_CLOCK_HZ        ( 12000000UL )
            #define configTICK_RATE_HZ        ( ( portTickType ) 1000 )
            #define configMINIMAL_STACK_SIZE  ( ( unsigned short ) 100 )
            #define configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE     ( ( size_t ) ( 4 * 1024 ) )
    - hardware dependent code 
        - lives in separate files for each compiler toolchain and CPU architecture
        - hardware specific config is defined in those files
    - example
        - tasks.c does not want to know hardware dependent details
        - has to enter a critical section to do stuff
        - call a global macro to do the work
        - different hardware has different sets of code to do same things
            - different functionality
            - same names of functions
    - #define
        - may be inconvenient/complicated
        - allows for FreeRTOS to be recompiled for different system architecture
        - only have to change hardware-dependent files
        - for embedded systems/lower level things, overhead of "real" functions is not worth advantages

scheduling tasks
- task priorities and ready list
    - user-assigned priorities
        - each task has a priority from 0 to configMAX_PRIORITIES-1
            - configMAX_PRIORITIES-1 is a compile-time value
        - lowest to highest
    - ready list
        - keep track of all tasks ready to run
        - array of task lists based on priorities
- system tick
    - heartbeat of FreeRTOS system
    - there is a periodic tick interrupt
    - when a tick interrupt fires, vTaskSwitchContext() is called
        - vTaskSwitchContext() picks the highest-priority ready task
        - puts it in the pxCurrentTCB variable
        - steps
            - while loop to look for priority level with ready tasks in pxReadyTasksLists[]
            - listGET_OWNER_OF_NEXT_ENTRY() grabs the next ready task in that level's ready list
            - pxCurrentTCB points to highest priority task
            - when vTaskSwitchContext() ends, hardware dependent code starts running that task
        - most important lines of code in FreeRTOS:
            /* Find the highest-priority queue that contains ready tasks. */
            while( listLIST_IS_EMPTY( &( pxReadyTasksLists[ uxTopReadyPriority ] ) ) )
            {
                configASSERT( uxTopReadyPriority );
                --uxTopReadyPriority;
            }

            /* listGET_OWNER_OF_NEXT_ENTRY walks through the list, so the tasks of the same 
            priority get an equal share of the processor time. */
            listGET_OWNER_OF_NEXT_ENTRY( pxCurrentTCB, &( pxReadyTasksLists[ uxTopReadyPriority ] ) );
        - pxReadyTasksLists[] is like a list of linked lists of tasks

data structures
- task
    - main job of os is to run and cooridinate user tasks
    - basic unit of FreeRTOS is task
    - Task Control Block (TCB)
        - represents each individual task
        - defined in tasks.c
        - *pxTopOfStack needs to be first member of struct
            - this points to last item placed on tasks stack
            - allow for growth on the linear stick
        - has checks for stack overflows
        - uxPriority and uxBasePriority
            - can change priority if needed
        - xGenericListItem and xEventListItem
            - task has 2 list items for use in FreeRTOS scheduling lists
            - when task is inserted into a list, it does not insert pointer directly to tcb
            - pointer to xGenericListItem and xEventListItem
            - more flexibility for lists 
            - better than pointer directly to tcb
            - q: is there a global place to store pointers that point to beginning of task structs?
        - 4 states
            - running, ready to run, suspended, or blocked
            - tcb does not store this info
            - FreeRTOS tracks task state by putting the task in the correct list
                - ready list, suspended list, etc.
            - change task state by putting in different list
    - task setup
        - xTaskCreate()
            - called when a task is created
            - newly allocated tcb object to store base info
            - allocate amount of stack user requests
            - task is made to look like new task is already running
                - treat new tasks the same as current tasks
                - scheduler does not have special case to handle
                - probably good for maintanance and efficiency, one less thing to check 
                - made to look like it was interrupted by a context switch
                    - specifics depend on architecture FreeRTOS is running on
                - Q: what does the example of pxPortInitialiseStack mean?
                    - my guess is that each decrement is going through different caches?
            - example of pxPortInitialiseStack
                - ARM Cortex-M3 processor pushes registers on the stack when a task is interrupted
                - pxPortInitialiseStack() modifies the stack to look like the registers were pushed even though the task hasn't actually started running yet
                - don't actually need to store data for those registers
                - just need to allocate space for them
                - Q: so it's like a mock?
            - disable interrupts before messing with lists
                - basically acts like a lock
                - don't want operations on a changing list, atomicity issues
            - need to initialize lists 
                - array of priority lists
                - suspended list
                - killed list
                - delayed list
            - new task can get added to the respective priority list
- list
    - main purpose
        - used to keep track of tasks for scheduling
        - implement queues 
    - structure
        - standard circular doubly linked list
- queue
