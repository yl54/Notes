- q: what is a cluster?
    - a cluster is a set of loosely or tightly connected computers that work together
    - usually connected via fast local area networks
    - usually are running on same hardware and operating system
    - deployed to improve performance/availability over a single computer
    - more cost-effective than single computers of comparable speed/availability
    - low cost microprocessors, hish-speed networks, and software for high performance distributed computing
    - connect a number of readily available nodes via lan
    - activities of nodes orchestrated by a software layer just above
    - nodes are managed via centralized management approach
    - clusters used for high computation services as opposed to io oriented applications
    - clusters may end up having redundant nodes
    - clusters good for reliability, load balancing, fault tolerance
    - clusters usually have slaves + masters
        - slaves communitcate to masters
        - slaves have own version of same os, local memory, disk space
- managing a cluster
    - task scheduling
        - large amounts of data messes stuff up
        - how to map tasks onyo CPU cores and GPU devices
    - node failure management
        - fencing, make sure node is isolated

job schedulers 
- a computer application to control unattended background program execution of jobs
- main data structure to organize this stuff is a job queue
- basic features:
    - interfaces to help define workflows/job dependencies
    - automatic submission of executions
    - interfaces to monitor executions
    - priorities/queues to control execution order of unrelated jobs
- advanced features
    - real-time scheduling based off of external/unpredictable events
    - automatic restart/recovery when failure occurs
    - alerting/notifications
    - incident report generation
    - audit trails
- main concepts
    - jobs
    - dependencies
    - job streams
    - users
- architecture
    - master/agent arch
    - cooperative arch
